### Features and Description :
This is another clone of WhatsApp but with additional features like media sharing like image files and audio too.
App shows whether is user is online offline, last seen, last message shared in messages list and shows when the user is typing all in real-time.
This one is bit unique as it uses mongoDb's native queries against what we usually do with mongoose, Hence a better look into the native methods. Live not available due to some limitations on the free tiers. But the app works just fine on localhost.
